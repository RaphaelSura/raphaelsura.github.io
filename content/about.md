I am an AI scientist and Python developer transitioning from the world of academic research. I am passionate about building and fixing things, working with complex systems, automating tasks, and making sense of data.

Before turning fully to AI technologies and Python, I worked as an experimental quantum physicist at Cornell University (USA) and Copenhagen University (Denmark). Experimental research has taught me practical ways to collect, transform, analyze, and visualize data in the most automated way. Most importantly, I have learned to deal with complex systems and deconstruct them until they can be managed.

I am currently working as an AI research scientist in Denmarkâ€™s largest hospital, building deep learning models to process medical images.
